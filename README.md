# SAR-PROCESSING
The functions for processing SAR images


These functions allow viewing of large SAR images through decompositions that are separated into scripts.  
To run the scripts, you need to load images into memory using the read function, enter the row and column  
number, which can be found in the .ann file that accompanies the images. Images can be downloaded from [NAZA's](https://uavsar.asfdaac.alaska.edu/) website in binary format.

Obs: when you download the images, put them in the data folder then set it as your working directory.
